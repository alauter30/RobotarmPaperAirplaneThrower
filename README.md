# ADL/Franklin Robot Arm
Once a long long time ago, Franklin and me were working on a robot arm that could throw a paper airplane, I have mostly worked on modeling and building the Arm, making sure it was functional while Frankie worked on the code and functionality of said arm.

As of now, the project sadly remains unfinished with the Modeling and building complete but the code currently unfinsished.
# Relfection

This Project was a boatload of fun to shape and form, but very time-consuming. Since this is my first year with this new software to code with it has been a challenge for me to find learn not only to effectively code but to use this new one. Frankie and I were at the eve of this awesome proejct and I will take the opportunity to finish it if the chance arises.

Currently Frankie holds the semblance of the code to the servo and possibly to the button that releases the  paper airplane, I am not sure however.



# Use

This Robot would simply throw an airplane, so that you would have the comfort of not cutting your fingers on it.
(Gloves could work too.)
